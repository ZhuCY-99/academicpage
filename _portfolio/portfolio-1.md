Taking Nanjing as the study area, this paper classifies school districts into key and ordinary categories based on zoning policies and enrollment rates. A questionnaire survey of parents of primary and secondary school students is conducted to examine residential conditions, social stratification, and neighborhood interactions of school-age families. Comparative analysis between the two types of school districts is then used to reveal the current residential spatial differentiation caused by unequal distribution of educational resources. Finally, the paper offers constructive suggestions based on the findings, aiming to provide support for government decision-making.
