In the context of ecological civilization, urban construction and development are becoming increasingly refined, placing higher demands on the measurement of urban ecological environments. However, existing assessments are often constrained by limited data sources and fail to adequately reflect conditions at the fine scale of urban centers. To bridge this gap, this study employs the DeepForest deep learning package, leveraging transfer learning and multi-source data to achieve high-precision identification and classification of ecological space elements. Taking into account the characteristics of high-density urban areas, ecosystem service demand is assessed from three dimensions: access to green space, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, and noise reduction. In parallel, the service capacity of vectorized trees is evaluated through indicators including solar exposure, competition, and visibility. Furthermore, population distribution at the block level is estimated by linearly fitting the seventh national census data with building floor area statistics, enabling a refined assessment of ecosystem service demand and capacity at the block scale. The resulting block-level supply–demand distribution maps provide an evidence base for enhancing ecosystem services, optimizing ecological spaces, and guiding ecological renewal and construction in urban centers.
