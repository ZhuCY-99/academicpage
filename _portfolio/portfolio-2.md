Located along the Yangtze River on the outskirts of Nanjing, the Qixia Harbor site is currently dominated by petrochemical industry land use. However, it faces contradictions: an ecologically important yet environmentally degraded setting, industrial relocation that presents new opportunities, and rich cultural resources but weak local identity. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of “conjugation,” leveraging urban design to resolve conflicts, enhance strengths, and promote integrated development of ecology, industry, and culture, thereby creating a model for future smart cities.
