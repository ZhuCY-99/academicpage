excerpt: 'This study proposes a method for classifying based on natural language processing. A case study was conducted employing this method, hotspot detection and driving force analysis, wherein the driving forces industrial development during the “13th Five-Year plan” period in Jiangsu province were determined. After analyzing the driving forces of the changes in the number of manufacturing industries mentioned above, we found that manufacturing base, distance from town, population, GDP per capita, distance from the railway station were the significant driving factors of changes in the manufacturing industries mentioned above.'

The development of China’s manufacturing industry has received global attention. However, research on the distribution pattern, changes, and driving forces of the manufacturing industry has been limited by the accessibility of data. This study proposes a method for classifying based on natural language processing. A case study was conducted employing this method, hotspot detection and driving force analysis, wherein the driving forces industrial development during the “13th Five-Year plan” period in Jiangsu province were determined. The main conclusions of the empirical case study are as follows. 1) Through the acquisition of Amap’s point-of-interest (POI, a special point location that commonly used in modern automotive navigation systems.) data, an industry type classification algorithm based on the natural language processing of POI names is proposed, with Jiangsu Province serving as an example. The empirical test shows that the accuracy was 95%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.872. 2) The seven types of manufacturing industries including the pulp and paper (PP) industry, metallurgical chemical (MC) industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing (PM) industry, machinery and electronics (ME) industry, wood furniture (WF) industry, textile clothing (TC) industry, and agricultural and food product processing (AF) industry are drawn through a 1 km× 1km projection grid. The evolution map of the spatial pattern and the density field hotspots are also drawn. 3) After analyzing the driving forces of the changes in the number of manufacturing industries mentioned above, we found that manufacturing base, distance from town, population, GDP per capita, distance from the railway station were the significant driving factors of changes in the manufacturing industries mentioned above. The results of this research can help guide the development of manufacturing industries, maximize the advantages of regional factors and conditions, and provide insight into how the spatial layout of the manufacturing industry could be optimized.
