excerpt: "Urban central areas face significant mismatches between green space service supply and demand, requiring precise identification and evaluation. Using multi-source data and deep learning, this study builds an “element identification–service supply and demand” framework and applies it to Beijing’s core area. Results show that while large parks and tree-lined avenues provide higher service capacity, high-density commercial zones exhibit greater demand, leading to mismatches in public green space and dense built environments.

Urban central areas, as typical regions with prominent conflicts between ecosystem service supply and demand, require high-precision identification of green spaces and evaluation of service supply and demand to provide scientific basis for planning improvements. Trees, being crucial components and service carriers of green spaces, present a challenge for accurate identification, which is a prerequisite for refined evaluations of green space services. This study utilizes multi-source data and deep learning methods, considering data availability, the multidimensional impacts of complex built environments on service capacity, and the typical demands for urban green space services. An "element identification-service supply and demand" analytical framework was constructed and applied to the core area of Beijing for analysis. The results indicate that:
(1) In terms of service capacity, large parks and tree-lined avenues exhibit higher green space service capacities, while the service capacity of ancillary green spaces is relatively limited due to the influence of the built environment.
(2) In terms of service demand, high-density commercial and office areas generally exhibit higher service demand, while the demand around green spaces and water bodies is lower.
(3) Regarding the supply-demand relationship, mismatches are caused by service blind spots in public green spaces and the high-density built environment.
