excerpt: "This study examines street-side green spaces in Beijing’s old city as alternative high-accessibility areas when park expansion is limited. Using spatial syntax and fitness app trajectory data, we analyze how street network and environmental factors influence running and cycling route choices. Results show distinct preferences for different activities, highlighting the potential of optimizing street spaces to improve urban green accessibility.

Urban green space accessibility is widely studied, yet in Beijing’s old city, traditional strategies such as building more parks or expanding transport networks face significant constraints. This study shifts the focus from large parks to street-side green spaces, exploring their role as high-accessibility public spaces, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic when access to major parks was restricted. Using spatial syntax models combined with trajectory data from the fitness app KEEP, we examine the relationship between street network configuration, environmental attributes, and residents’ physical activity patterns. By linking high-precision running and cycling trajectories to segment-based syntactic indicators and contextual factors such as greenery, openness, and traffic lights, we compare preferences at both the individual (route-level) and collective (street-level) scales. Results reveal distinct behavioral patterns: cycling is associated with streets of higher overall accessibility, while running and walking tend to favor enclosed, greener routes with fewer intersections, often around historic or waterfront areas. These findings highlight the differentiated spatial needs of various forms of physical activity and suggest that, in historic urban cores where large-scale interventions are limited, optimizing street spaces offers a promising pathway to enhance urban green accessibility and support healthy city development.
