I am Zhu Chaoyang, a Ph.D. candidate in Resources and Environment at Tongji University, advised by Professor Wang Lan in the WLAN Lab. My research interests center on **urban nature, physical activity**, and the application of **urban big data**.

Prior to joining the WLAN Lab, I earned my Master’s degree in Urban Planning from Beijing University of Technology, under the supervision of Professor Shanwen Zheng, and was recognized as an Outstanding Graduate of Beijing. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Urban and Rural Planning from Nanjing Forestry University, graduating first in my cohort based on GPA.
